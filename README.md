# ChaosRadio ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/LumiFae/ChaosRadio/total)

ChaosRadio is a simple radio replacer for your SCP: SL servers running Exiled or LabAPI. It replaces both NTF and Chaos radios with their own individual channels.
This means that if you have a Chaos radio, you can talk to other people with a Chaos radio, and the same goes for NTF radios.

This plugin is quite customisable, and tries to keep the system as native to the base game as possible, hence why you can only replace spawned radios, and not
create new ones.

## Installation

If running LabAPI, you will also need 0Harmony.dll to be put in dependencies.

LabAPI:

Put the LabAPI .dll in your LabAPI plugins folder.

EXILED:

Just put the .dll inside your Exiled plugins folder. This is built for Exiled 9.3.0, but it may work for all 9.0.0 versions.
